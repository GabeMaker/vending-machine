In this exercise you will build the brains of a vending machine. It will accept money, make change, maintain inventory, and dispense products. All the things that you might expect a vending machine to accomplish.

The point of this kata to to provide an larger than trivial exercise that can be used to practice TDD. A significant portion of the effort will be in determining what tests should be written and, more importantly, written next.
